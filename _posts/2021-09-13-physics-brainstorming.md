For my physics project I would like to do something involving game engines. In my spare time I like
developing my own game engine and I think it would be nice to have a tangible product to present to
the physics phair.

There are three areas of game engine development that I can relate to physics:
1. Rendering: this involves the physics of light to produce a realistic frame
2. Physics: physics simulation in games tend to be a bit limited however this is
the area I would like to focus on the most.
3. Audio: using principles of standing waves high fidelity audio solutions can
be built. I'm not very interested in this field so audio will be basic if there is any.

Because I'm not a genius, I won't be writing a physics library from scratch. I have two main libraries
to choose from: PhysX and Bullet.

These two libraries are well known and are both great options. PhysX is developed by Nvidia and used in
numerous game engines. Bullet is used in the popular and powerful Unreal Engine. I have no prior
experience on working with physics engines so this will be a new experience for me. I may have to change
libraries later on but I think I will start with PhysX for now.

3D rendering is also of great interest to me but I think it should take a backseat. It's important that
I actually have a product to show at the physics phair so I shouldn't be too ambitious. If there's extra
time I would also like to research some fluid simulations as I think those are cool.

I realize that this is a pretty broad topic, so it might not be a good fit for a physics phair. In addition
I have no "testable question" or "hypothesis" I want to test or answer. My project will probably have more
smoke and mirrors and will focus on wowing an audience rather than having any real substance.

Perhaps something I could do is compare the results from the physics simulation with real life measurements.
I could then suggest improvements to the simulation and state what impact it would have on the performance
of the physics engine.
