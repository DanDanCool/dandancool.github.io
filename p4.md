## Physics Lab
### Gravity
The goal of this lab is to judge the realism of the gravity in the physics simulation by using theoretical knowledge and
real world measurements.

In the first experiment, we time the amount of time it takes for an object to be released (iniial velocty = 0) from some
height to the ground. The first trial will be done under Earth gravity, using 5 different heights and 5 measurements for
each height.
- Constants: gravity, mass
- Independent: height
- Dependent: time

The next four trials will be done under different values of gravity to compare the simulation to the theoretical values.
Since the value of gravity will no longer match Earth's gravity, real world measurements cannot be used.

The next experiment will measure the time it takes for an object to roll down a frictionless ramp due to gravity. The
object will be released with an initial velocity of 0. The height the object is released from will be kept constant,
however the angle of the ramp will be changed.
- Constant: height
- Independent: angle of ramp
- Dependent: time

The first trial will be done using Earth gravity. For real world measurement, a ball will be used to reduce friction
where possible. The next four trials will be done using different values of gravity, and will compare the simulation to
theoretical values.

### Friction: Static and Kinetic
The goal of this lab is to judge the realism of the friction in the physics simulation by using theoretical knowledge.

The first experiment will measure static friction by placing an object on a ramp with some known coefficient of
friction, and then raising the angle of the ramp until the object starts moving. Since the coefficient of friction
cannot be determined in real world without using theoretical knowledge, real world values will not be used.
- Constants: mass
- Independent: angle of ramp
- Dependent: static coefficient of friction

The next experiment will measure the time it takes for an object to slow to a complete stop due to kinetic friction.
Sinnce the coefficient of friction cannot be determined in real world without using theoretical knowledge, real world
measurements will not be done.
- Constants: gravity, mass, initial velocity
- Independent: coefficient of friction
- Dependent: time

#### Stress Test: Gears
The goal of this simulation is to see if the simulation can properly apply contact forces to make the gears move. This
is kind of complicated to set up so this may be cut due to time constraints.

### Conservation of Energy
The goal of this lab is to judge the realism of the energy in the physics simulation by using theoretical knowledge and
real world measurements.

The first experiment will be about conservation of mechanical energy. In this experiment, the gravitational potential
energy is converted into kinetic energy. The initial kinetic energy of the object should be 0 joules. An object is
dropped down a ramp from a certain height and we measure the velocity of the object when it's at the bottom. The
simulation is frictionless.
- Constants: gravity, mass
- Independent: height
- Dependent: velocity

For the real world measurements, the velocity will be measured by timing how long it takes for the object to roll across
10 meters. The object used will be a ball to decrease the effects of friction.

The second experiment will use the force of friction to determine how far an object traveling at some predetermined
velocity will travel before halting.
- Constants: gravity, mass, velocity
- Independent: Coefficient of Friction
- Dependent: distance traveling before stopping

The experiment uses the definition of work in order to calculate the distance the object will travel. W = Fd. Due to the
difficulty of controlling velocity and values of friction in the real world, measurements will not be used.

#### Stress Test: Newton's Cradle
A model of Newton's Cradle will be modeled in the simulation world. It will be observed over some arbitrary amount of
time to see if any energy is added or lost in the system.

### Conservation of Momentum
The goal of this lab is to judge the realism of the collisions in the physics simulation by using theoretical knowledge.
Friction is assumed to not have an impact. The law of conservation of momentum is used to judge the realism of the
simulation. Because there are no such things as perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic in the real world, measurements
will not be used. In addition, it is exceedingly difficult to set up an experiment that is repeatable and reliable with
limited resources.

The first experiment uses perfectly elastic collision. The goal of this experiment will be to observe that both
conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy are true. Two objects will be used to collide against each
other. The collision will be head-on, so that only one dimension will be considered.
- Constants: mass
- Independent: v1, v2, initial total momentum, initial total kinetic energy
- Dependent: vf1, ff2, final total momentum, final total kinetic energy

The same experiment will be repeated but using perfectly inelastic collision.
- Constants: mass
- Independent: v1, v2, initial total momentum, initial total kinetic energy
- Dependent: vf1, ff2, final total momentum, final total kinetic energy

#### Stress Test: Explosion
In a simulation world, there will be a stack of blocks. A giant block is going to smash into the stack. The goal of the
stress test is to observe whether any momentum is gained or lost in the simulation. The "up-down" direction will not be
considered as gravity will add extra momentum into the system.
